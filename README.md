## FCC -> Responsive Web Design Projects -> Project 3: Product Landing Page

__<u>Note:</u>__ This project is my submission for the freeCodeCamp project named above.

> __<u>Objective:</u>__ Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

> Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

> You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. 
> * Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. 
> * You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. 
> * Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. 
> * Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. 
> * We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

> * __User Story #1:__ My product landing page should have a __header__ element with a corresponding __id="header"__.
> * __User Story #2:__ I can see an __image__ within the __header__ element with a corresponding __id="header-img"__. A company logo would make a good image here.
> * __User Story #3:__ Within the __#header__ element I can see a __nav__ element with a corresponding __id="nav-bar"__.
> * __User Story #4:__ I can see at least three clickable elements inside the __nav__ element, each with the class __nav-link__.
> * __User Story #5:__ When I click a __.nav-link__ button in the __nav__ element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
> * __User Story #6:__ I can watch an embedded product video with __id="video"__.
> * __User Story #7:__ My landing page has a __form__ element with a corresponding __id="form"__.
> * __User Story #8:__ Within the form, there is an __input__ field with __id="email"__ where I can enter an email address.
> * __User Story #9:__ The __#email__ input field should have __placeholder__ text to let the user know what the field is for.
> * __User Story #10:__ The __#email__ input field uses __HTML5 validation__ to confirm that the entered text is an _email address_.
> * __User Story #11:__ Within the form, there is a __submit input__ with a corresponding __id="submit"__.
> * __User Story #12:__ When I click the __#submit__ element, the email is submitted to a __static page__ (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
> * __User Story #13:__ The __navbar__ should always be at the __top__ of the viewport.
> * __User Story #14:__ My product landing page should have __at least one media query__.
> * __User Story #15:__ My product landing page should utilize __CSS flexbox__ at least __once__.
